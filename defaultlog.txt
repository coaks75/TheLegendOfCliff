You fall into a dark room, you can't see anyhting it's so dark.
You light the lantern on your backpack.

Main Room :
The room is big and open. You don't see much here but an altar in the center, and a door in each cardinal direction. The door to the west pops open from the shock wave of you hitting the ground. 
Exits: east, south, north, west, 
Items:Broom, Altar, Backpack, Super Puzzle Piece, 
> go south
Southern Door :

Exits: south, north, 
Items:Invisible Container,

It looks like your Legend of Cliff will end here.
