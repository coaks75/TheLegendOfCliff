You fall into a dark room, you can't see anyhting it's so dark.
You light the lantern on your backpack.

Main Room :
The room is big and open. You don't see much here but an altar in the center, and a door in each cardinal direction. The door to the west pops open from the shock wave of you hitting the ground. 
     Exits: east, south, north, west, 
     Items: Broom, Altar, Backpack, 
     There is currently no monster in the room.
> go west
Western Door :
This door is open. There is a carving on the door that reads 'Turn around! Don't do it! save yourself! They've come afte...' It ends there 
     Exits: east, west, 
     Items: Currently nothing.
     There is currently no monster in the room.
> go west
Western Hallway :
You walk into the begginning of a long passageway. You can't see all the way down the hallway. Slightly down the hall however; you see two doors. One to the north and one to the south. 
     Exits: east, south, north, west, 
     Items: Currently nothing.
     There is currently no monster in the room.

Sleeping Chamber :
This looks like it was a sleeping chamber for the queen's Royal Guard. Someone must have been stuck in here, because it looks like there is a skeleton in the corner. 
     Exits: south, 
     Items: Sword, 
     There is currently no monster in the room.
> equip sword
You equipped Sword
