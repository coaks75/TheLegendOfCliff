You fall through a trap after taking the gem!
You fall into a dark room, you can't see anyhting it's so dark.
You light the lantern on your backpack.

Main Room :
The room is big and open. You don't see much here but an altar in the center, and a door in each cardinal direction. The door to the west pops open from the shock wave of you hitting the ground. 
Exits: east, south, north, west, 

> go north
Northern Door :
You look at the door. There seem to be three different sized cut outs on the door. There is nothing on the ground around. 
Exits: south, north, 

> go south
